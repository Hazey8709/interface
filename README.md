# Branch Details:

#### Main: 
*The "Main" branch was orignally the project shell. Had an issue merging branches and  <br>
"Main" branch became the final result of project*.  <br>

#### Dev: 
*The "Dev" branch is for development only*. <br>

#### MileStone2: 
*"Milestone2" branch is Mod-2, 2.3 final result. This branch is still a work in progress and <br>
more will be added next week for Mod-3. Everything is working for the most part react routing <br>
works as expected, profile page is up and works just needs some alignment & design changes. Todo-List <br>
page works and todoList is functional but not best practice(Might get changed to Roller Dex). Dashboard loads <br>
maps and works correctly but could use some changes. Mapbox is not functional yet and is a work in progress <br>
but page does work*. <br>

# Milestones:



### Milestone #1

**Figma Prototype Link**: https://www.figma.com/file/4fOe2WpMTxNBy4A75khv6e/Remake?node-id=0%3A1&t=N8Mi84sgoASyCcAQ-1

**Details**: <br>
In milestone 1 I built a working prototype in Figma. The prototype will show the design and basic layout of the project. <br>
The table of contents in figma will roughly explain the project and what or who it's for. The figma link can be viewed by any <br>
one with the link from above. <br>



### Milestone #2

**Details**: <br>
In milestone 2 I will be completing the basic layout using React.js for the frontend. React-Router will be installed and working, <br>
I'm using the router to change pages from navigation component. The pages won't be fully done but we will be able to change pages <br>
to see the project and have a basic layout. Links will be functional in Quick-Links box below navigation. The Quick Links box will <br>
have various links to my projects or sites. <br>


**üåµ Challenges**: Getting mapbox up and running as expected has been giving me an issue. Working on it and might change to a  <br>
react map library instead. Depending how it goes i'll make a decision. <br>
**üèÜ Accomplishments**: For the most part everything seems to be going smoothly & mostly everything is laid out. <br>
