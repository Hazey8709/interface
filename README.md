# Branch:

**Main**: Final Project <br>
**Dev**: Development<br>

# API's
**Rechart** <br>
**Mapbox-gl** <br>
**Faker.js** <br>



# Details:

**Using**: *React, React-Router, React-Router-Dom, NPM, Express, Axios, nodemon.*   <br>
<br>
*My Final Project is Interface. Interface is a user interface where you can keep notes,  <br>
look things in the 3D/2D map and Has a User Profile. We will be using Recharts API, Mapbox-gl API, <br>
Faker.js API.*




# Milestones:



### Milestone #1

**Figma Prototype Link**: https://www.figma.com/file/4fOe2WpMTxNBy4A75khv6e/Remake?node-id=0%3A1&t=N8Mi84sgoASyCcAQ-1

**Details**: <br>
In milestone 1 I built a working prototype in Figma. The prototype will show the design and basic layout of the project. <br>
The table of contents in figma will roughly explain the project and what or who it's for. The figma link can be viewed by any <br>
one with the link from above. <br>



### Milestone #2

**Details**: <br>
In milestone 2 I will be completing the basic layout using React.js for the frontend. React-Router will be installed and working, <br>
I'm using the router to change pages from navigation component. The pages won't be fully done but we will be able to change pages <br>
to see the project and have a basic layout. Links will be functional in Quick-Links box below navigation. The Quick Links box will <br>
have various links to my projects or sites. <br>














# React Details:
### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
