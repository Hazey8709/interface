# Milestones:



### Milestone #1

**Figma Prototype Link**: https://www.figma.com/file/4fOe2WpMTxNBy4A75khv6e/Remake?node-id=0%3A1&t=N8Mi84sgoASyCcAQ-1

**Details**: <br>
In milestone 1 I built a working prototype in Figma. The prototype will show the design and basic layout of the project. <br>
The table of contents in figma will roughly explain the project and what or who it's for. The figma link can be viewed by any <br>
one with the link from above. <br>



### Milestone #2

**Details**: <br>
In milestone 2 I will be completing the basic layout using React.js for the frontend. React-Router will be installed and working, <br>
I'm using the router to change pages from navigation component. The pages won't be fully done but we will be able to change pages <br>
to see the project and have a basic layout. Links will be functional in Quick-Links box below navigation. The Quick Links box will <br>
have various links to my projects or sites. <br>


**üåµ Challenges**: Getting mapbox up and running as expected has been giving me an issue. Working on it and might change to a  <br>
react map library instead. Depending how it goes i'll make a decision. <br>
**üèÜ Accomplishments**: For the most part everything seems to be going smoothly & mostly everything is laid out. <br>
